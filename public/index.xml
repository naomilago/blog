      <description>⠀Hello, my name is Naomi Lago, I&amp;rsquo;m 18 and, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I&amp;rsquo;m a Pisces. I was born in a small city in the São Paulo state of Brazil. I&amp;rsquo;m an Internet Computer technician, I&amp;rsquo;ve studied Computer Maintenance and Support technician degree for one year back in 2019 and now I&amp;rsquo;m an undergraduate in Cyber Defense.
⠀As you can see, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been passionate about technology and since I was a child one of my biggest dreams was surely explore new technologies and make huge projects.</description>

      <description>Be the Hero ⠀I developed Be the Hero during an event called Semana Omnistack 11.0 organized by Rocketseat and it is an open-source project. The idea is to build bridges between NGOs and people who want to contribute to them. Users can access many fundings and choose which one they will contribute while the organizations can register many fundings based on their activities.
⠀This was one of the first projects I made using Node.</description>
