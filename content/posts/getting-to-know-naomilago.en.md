⠀Hello, welcome to my first post. I don't know if you are visiting when it has just been released or after a week, a month or simply because you felt interested in knowing more about me after reading some other posts. In this post, I will talk about some of my plans for the future and what I expect from this blog.

⠀Oh, and during this conversation, you may feel as if you are talking to me personally - just as I feel about this project when I write here.

<br />

### What are my goals?

⠀Well, as a trans woman who loves and studies technology, I see myself as being underrepresented in this area in its various fields. Because there are very few references of people like me working in the technology field, I try to prove (even to myself) that the possibility to study and work with what you really like is real, no matter which minority group you come from. As the technological advance is real and we can connect with countless people around the world, creating the blog has been the way I found to reach these people and have my little place to express my ideas, my new knowledge, my experiences etc. in the midst of this immense cyberspace.

<br />

### Why did I create this blog?

⠀Since I started my studies in IT (Information Technology), I always imagined myself developing a project where I could have the freedom to be myself and, being myself, promote some positive change - however small it may be. I have tried creating a podcast (yes, a podcast), a youtube channel (exactly) but creating this blog was one of the last things I thought of but the one that attracted me the most. Add the fact that I don't do very well with cameras or even audios, writing was a great alternative - mainly because I love to write. The freedom to attach a photo or video to your post is also amazing! Check out this beautiful lavender field at the end and then tell me what your favorite color is in the comments (I think it's only fair that I include my favorite color in my first post, don't you?!).

<br />

### What do I expect from you?

⠀I expect you, like me, to be open to the new and unknown and to always carry respect and empathy with you. I hope that when you agree with what I say, you will tell me what you agree with. I hope in the same way that when you disagree, you will also talk about it. I hope you will feel free to express yourself both here in the comments and on social media when contacting me to make everything as pleasant as possible.

<br />

### We're coming to the end...

⠀We're coming to the end of this first post and I would like to reinforce that you can always contact me by writing a comment, sending me an email or communicating through my social networks.

⠀Oh, and at the end of every post, I intend to bring some indications that will lead you to know or review books, movies, videos, etc. so that our discussions become even richer in terms of references or even entertainment. Today, I would just like to share this photo and exchange this conversation with you.

⠀Thank you for reading this far, we'll talk again in the next post : )
