## Be the Hero

⠀I developed Be the Hero during an event called Semana Omnistack 11.0 organized by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/ "Rocketseat") and it is an open-source project. The idea is to build bridges between NGOs and people who want to contribute to them. Users can access many fundings and choose which one they will contribute while the organizations can register many fundings based on their activities.

⠀This was one of the first projects I made using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js"), [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React") and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/ "React Native") technologies. It's so special to me. Once Be the Hero is open-source, you can find more about it on my [Github repository](https://github.com/naomilago/BeTheHero "Be the Hero project").

## Healthier

⠀Healthier is also a very special project because I could deal with UX/UI Design, which is another thing I love. It consists of an application that helps you to find better ways to have healthy meals, good recipes and tips for living a healthier life. When I came up with this idea I got so excited and I had a good time designing it and you can find more about it on my [Figma repository](https://www.figma.com/file/ARY6RmJYci18Ss9mwBWmEm/Naomi-Lago-Healthier-1.0 "Healthier project").  
⠀PS.: Healthier is still a prototype until now. Feel free to develop the application as you want, as long as you keep it free and open-source : )

## Pet Paws

⠀I also developed Pet Paws - also an open-source application - that gathers the pets available for adoption in its vicinity, providing users with the facility to do a good deed and contribute to reducing mistreatment.

⠀During the process, I got a huge contribution from [Rafael](https://github.com/tsuyusk "Contribuitor") and you can find more about the project on my [Github repository](https://github.com/naomilago/Pet-Paws "Pet Paws project").
