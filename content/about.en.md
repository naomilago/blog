⠀Hello, my name is Naomi Lago, I'm 18 and, if you're interested, I'm a Pisces. I was born in a small city in the São Paulo state of Brazil. I'm an Internet Computer technician, I've studied Computer Maintenance and Support technician degree for one year back in 2019 and now I'm an undergraduate in Cyber Defense.

⠀As you can see, I've always been passionate about technology and since I was a child one of my biggest dreams was surely explore new technologies and make huge projects. I had good moments exploring Web Development, UX/UI Design etc. but when I got to know more about the Cybersecurity field it was love at first sight.

⠀I always wanted to be a creator. I wanted to share what I know (or what I believe I know) with people so that they could have different points of view on the same subject and also be able to create - thus instigating other people to also create.

⠀If you enjoy my content, make sure you're following me on social media. There is where you'll be notified when a new post comes up.

⠀See you around and keep being yourself : )
